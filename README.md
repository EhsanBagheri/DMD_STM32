See [video](https://youtu.be/lw87UqoO50E) and dmd_multicolor example for details.

### Version v1.1.0 - Add support of F6353/FM6363 S-PWM drivers
### Attention! The repository was recently updated to v1.0.0
The main difference from 0.x.x versions is a new panel template format. The documentation will coming. You can get a brief explanation of the new templates from the comments of the [DMD_Panel_Templates.h](https://github.com/board707/DMD_STM32/blob/dev-V2/DMD_Panel_Templates.h) file.
### For last version with old panel templates [see v0.9.5](https://github.com/board707/DMD_STM32/releases/tag/v0.9.5)
The main improvement of the 0.9.x versions is the **support of the Raspberry Pi Pico and another RP2040-based boards**. Version 0.9.4 added Turkish font examples and some bugfixes.

About the library
-----------------

The library initially started out as STM32 port of Freetronics DMD library (https://github.com/freetronics/DMD). Now it has grown into a separate project with support for different types of monochrome, two-color and RGB panels. 

One of the important features of the library is support of Adafruit GFX format fonts: https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-gfx-graphics-library/using-fonts. Using Adafruit `fontconvert` utility allows users to convert and display on DMD matrix Truetype fonts, including Unicode fonts with national characters of almost any language. The library includes **Cyrillic** and **Turkish** fonts. For using of national fonts, see the examples `dmd_rg.ino` and `dmd_rgb_turk.ino` (Turkish)

This code branch is further development of [DMD_STM32 library](https://github.com/board707/DMD_STM32/tree/old-V1). The code was totally rewritten, the library received a modular structure with a DMD_STM32a base class and several child classes for various matrices and connection types.

The set of supported matrices is constantly updated.

**Adding a new panels to the library**

If your panel is not supported by the library yet, please feel free to open an issue using [template](https://github.com/board707/DMD_STM32/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&projects=&template=add-a-new-panel-template.md&title=Add+a+new+panel)

Other features
------------
 - The graphics subsystem is inherited from Adafruit GFX library https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit-GFX-Library
 - Dual memory buffering for reducing scanning artefacts and making some visual effects
 - Two color modes for RGB: highcolor RGB444 and low memory consuming RGB111 mode for LED signs, information boards etc.
 - Chaining up to 100 panels for Monochrome (46 tested) or 16 for RGB 64x32. The number of matrices is limited by the size of the controller memory.
 - For monochrome display - a new "Parallel" connection scheme, in which each horizontal row of panels is connected to a separate R_DATA pin


Compatible boards
-----------------

* STM32F1 - STM32F103C8 (bluepill) and STM32F103C6 boards tested 
* STM32F4 - STM32F401CC and STM32F411CE boards

Installation
-------------

There are two ways to install the library:
* Download ZIP-archive directly from [Releases](https://github.com/board707/DMD_STM32/releases) section, open your Arduino IDE, click on `Sketch > Include Library > Add . ZIP Library`. Choose the zip file you just downloaded.
* Using Library Manager (since Arduino IDE 1.6.2): navigate to `Sketch > Include Library > Manage Libraries` inside your Arduino IDE and search for the library, then click `Install`.

#### Pre-installation requirements

* Adafruit_GFX library

    DMD_STM32a project requires [Adafruit GFX library](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit-GFX-Library)

   
#### Arduino support packages for STM32 and Raspberry Pi Pico

* STM32

    The only Roger Clarks's repo https://github.com/rogerclarkmelbourne/Arduino_STM32 is supported for STM32 based boards on Arduino IDE.
  
  > Please note that Clark's repo versions prior [d05a128](https://github.com/rogerclarkmelbourne/Arduino_STM32/commit/d05a1289f1e2eaa5127a4bfed9602e2cd48c6ffe) (28 Apr 2024) is incompatible with recent Adafruit GFX library. Use Adafruit GFX version prior to 1.8.0 (v1.7.0 is OK) https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit-GFX-Library/releases/tag/1.7.0


* Raspberry Pi Pico

   This code requires Earle Philhower core https://github.com/earlephilhower/arduino-pico
